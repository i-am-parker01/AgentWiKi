Advanced Agentic AI using Groq &amp; LangChain
Sure! Here’s a professional and clear GitHub repository description for your project:

This repository contains an agentic AI application** built with Groq’s LPU-powered models and LangChain orchestration. The agent can:

* Perform math calculations 🧮
* Fetch information using Wikipedia search 🌐
* Maintain conversation memory for multi-turn interactions 🗣️

The project demonstrates a modern AI stack, combining high-speed LLM inference** with tool-based reasoning, and is ready to be wrapped in a FastAPI API for deployment.

## Tech Stack:

* Groq Chat Models (Google-gemma-9b)
* LangChain (agents, memory, tools)
* Python 3.9+

## Next Steps / Features:

* Add RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for custom knowledge bases
* Deploy as a FastAPI service

Perfect for learning modern agentic AI development and high-performance LLM integrations.
